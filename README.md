# Bringing Luxury Home

---

## Aim of the site

The client has stated they are unhappy with their current website and have asked for this to be redesigned to the follow specification;

A website to showcase the offerings of a door and doorset manufacturer based in Barnsley, UK. 
The primary aim of the website is to one showcase the types of craftsmanship available and products that can
be designed and produced within the factory.

The primary customer will be a joinery contractor or architect working on the refurbishment or new build project in areas such as high end hotels, listed buildings or direct to their private client.
As this is a neich market with very little competition the main requirement of the site is to drive awareness of Luxury Door Solutions as a new business.

As a business, they have provided me with the following goals for the site.

1. A simple but professional design.
2. A colour pallet to reflect the logo and current physical marketing material.
3. An form to pass potential customer details across to the estimating team.
4. Clear and upfront showing of what they offer beyond just the product.

## UX

As the company is newly established the existing client base is small and obtained through previous working relationships. the main aim is to draw new clients that meet the below criterias 

1. Based within the UK & Channel Islands.
2. Is working within the construction industry.
3. Works with wealthy clients on high end projects.
4. Focus on quality over quantity

To help this site stand out from the other door and door set manufacturers based in the UK it needs to ensure it
* Is easy to use.
* Doesn't overload the user with too many 'walls of text'.
* Reminds the user to start building a relationship with the company.
