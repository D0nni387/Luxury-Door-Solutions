## Aim of the site

A website to showcase the offerings of a door and doorset manufacturer based in Barnsley, UK. 
The primary aim of the website is to one showcase the types of craftsmanship available and products that can
be designed and produced within the factory.

The primary customer will be a joinery contractor or architect working on the refurbishment or new build project in areas such as high end hotels, listed buildings or direct to their private client.
As this is a neich market with very little competition the main requirement of the site is to drive awareness of Luxury Door Solutions as a new business.

As a business, they have provided me with the following goals for the site.

1. A simple but professional design.
2. A colour pallet to reflect the logo and current physical marketing material.
3. An form to pass potential customer details across to the estimating team.
4. Clear and upfront showing of what they offer beyond just the product.
